# HASHING_Mini_Project
The system scans random numbers, then slots them in the free space in memory. The number draw is done in 3 different size arrays. Each run is done 10 times on each array at intervals of 0.1 between 1-10. The goal is to find the optimum point that is the best ratio between the number of runs and the perception of position in memory.
